    -t <num_steps>
    -t <skip_steps>:<num_steps>
    -t <skip_steps>:<step_size>:<num_steps>
        default: skip_steps=0, step_size=1, num_steps=20

    -g
        generate an arbitrary trace that satisfies
        all assertions and assumptions.

    -i
        instead of BMC run temporal induction

    -c
        instead of regular BMC run cover analysis

    -m <module_name>
        name of the top module

    --smtc <constr_filename>
        read constraints file

    --cex <cex_filename>
        read cex file as written by ABC's "write_cex -n"

    --aig <prefix>
        read AIGER map file (as written by Yosys' "write_aiger -map")
        and AIGER witness file. The file names are <prefix>.aim for
        the map file and <prefix>.aiw for the witness file.

    --aig <aim_filename>:<aiw_filename>
        like above, but for map files and witness files that do not
        share a filename prefix (or use different file extensions).

    --aig-noheader
        the AIGER witness file does not include the status and
        properties lines.

    --yw <yosys_witness_filename>
        read a Yosys witness.

    --btorwit <btor_witness_filename>
        read a BTOR witness.

    --noinfo
        only run the core proof, do not collect and print any
        additional information (e.g. which assert failed)

    --presat
        check if the design with assumptions but without assertions
        is SAT before checking if assertions are UNSAT. This will
        detect if there are contradicting assumptions. In some cases
        this will also help to "warm up" the solver, potentially
        yielding a speedup.

    --final-only
        only check final constraints, assume base case

    --assume-skipped <start_step>
        assume asserts in skipped steps in BMC.
        no assumptions are created for skipped steps
        before <start_step>.

    --dump-vcd <vcd_filename>
        write trace to this VCD file
        (hint: use 'write_smt2 -wires' for maximum
        coverage of signals in generated VCD file)

    --dump-yw <yw_filename>
        write trace as a Yosys witness trace

    --dump-vlogtb <verilog_filename>
        write trace as Verilog test bench

    --vlogtb-top <hierarchical_name>
        use the given entity as top module for the generated
        Verilog test bench. The <hierarchical_name> is relative
        to the design top module without the top module name.

    --dump-smtc <constr_filename>
        write trace as constraints file

    --smtc-init
        write just the last state as initial constraint to smtc file

    --smtc-top <old>[:<new>]
        replace <old> with <new> in constraints dumped to smtc
        file and only dump object below <old> in design hierarchy.

    --noinit
        do not assume initial conditions in state 0

    --dump-all
        when using -g or -i, create a dump file for each
        step. The character '%' is replaced in all dump
        filenames with the step number.

    --append <num_steps>
        add <num_steps> time steps at the end of the trace
        when creating a counter example (this additional time
        steps will still be constrained by assumptions)

    --binary
        dump anyconst values as raw bit strings

    --keep-going
        continue BMC after the first failed assertion and report
        further failed assertions. To output multiple traces
        covering all found failed assertions, the character '%' is
        replaced in all dump filenames with an increasing number.
        In cover mode, don't stop when a cover trace contains a failed
        assertion.

    --check-witness
        check that the used witness file contains sufficient
        constraints to force an assertion failure.

    --detect-loops
        check if states are unique in temporal induction counter examples
        (this feature is experimental and incomplete)


    -s <solver>
        set SMT solver: z3, yices, boolector, bitwuzla, cvc4, mathsat, dummy
        default: yices

    -S <opt>
        pass <opt> as command line argument to the solver

    --timeout <value>
        set the solver timeout to the specified value (in seconds).

    --logic <smt2_logic>
        use the specified SMT2 logic (e.g. QF_AUFBV)

    --dummy <filename>
        if solver is "dummy", read solver output from that file
        otherwise: write solver output to that file

    -v
        enable debug output

    --unroll
        unroll uninterpreted functions

    --noincr
        don't use incremental solving, instead restart solver for
        each (check-sat). This also avoids (push) and (pop).

    --noprogress
        disable timer display during solving
        (this option is set implicitly on Windows)

    --dump-smt2 <filename>
        write smt2 statements to file

    --info <smt2-info-stmt>
        include the specified smt2 info statement in the smt2 output

    --nocomments
        strip all comments from the generated smt2 code
