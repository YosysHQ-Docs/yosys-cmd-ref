        write_blif [options] [filename]

    ::

        Write the current design to an BLIF file.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -top top_module

    ::

            set the specified module as design top module


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -buf <cell-type> <in-port> <out-port>

    ::

            use cells of type <cell-type> with the specified port names for buffers


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -unbuf <cell-type> <in-port> <out-port>

    ::

            replace buffer cells with the specified name and port names with
            a .names statement that models a buffer


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -true <cell-type> <out-port>

   

    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -false <cell-type> <out-port>

   

    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -undef <cell-type> <out-port>

    ::

            use the specified cell types to drive nets that are constant 1, 0, or
            undefined. when '-' is used as <cell-type>, then <out-port> specifies
            the wire name to be used for the constant signal and no cell driving
            that wire is generated. when '+' is used as <cell-type>, then <out-port>
            specifies the wire name to be used for the constant signal and a .names
            statement is generated to drive the wire.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -noalias

    ::

            if a net name is aliasing another net name, then by default a net
            without fanout is created that is driven by the other net. This option
            suppresses the generation of this nets without fanout.


    ::

        The following options can be useful when the generated file is not going to be
        read by a BLIF parser but a custom tool. It is recommended to not name the
        output file *.blif when any of this options is used.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -icells

    ::

            do not translate Yosys's internal gates to generic BLIF logic
            functions. Instead create .subckt or .gate lines for all cells.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -gates

    ::

            print .gate instead of .subckt lines for all cells that are not
            instantiations of other modules from this design.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -conn

    ::

            do not generate buffers for connected wires. instead use the
            non-standard .conn statement.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -attr

    ::

            use the non-standard .attr statement to write cell attributes


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -param

    ::

            use the non-standard .param statement to write cell parameters


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -cname

    ::

            use the non-standard .cname statement to write cell names


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -iname, -iattr

    ::

            enable -cname and -attr functionality for .names statements
            (the .cname and .attr statements will be included in the BLIF
            output after the truth table for the .names statement)


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -blackbox

    ::

            write blackbox cells with .blackbox statement.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -impltf

    ::

            do not write definitions for the $true, $false and $undef wires.
