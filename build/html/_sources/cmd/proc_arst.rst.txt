        This pass identifies asynchronous resets in the processes and converts them
        to a different internal representation that is suitable for generating
        flip-flop cells with asynchronous resets.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -global_arst [!]<netname>

    ::

            In modules that have a net with the given name, use this net as async
            reset for registers that have been assign initial values in their
            declaration ('reg foobar = constant_value;'). Use the '!' modifier for
            active low reset signals. Note: the frontend stores the default value
            in the 'init' attribute on the net.
