        dffinit [options] [selection]

    ::

        This pass sets an FF cell parameter to the the initial value of the net it
        drives. (This is primarily used in FPGA flows.)


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -ff <cell_name> <output_port> <init_param>

    ::

            operate on the specified cell type. this option can be used
            multiple times.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -highlow

    ::

            use the string values "high" and "low" to represent a single-bit
            initial value of 1 or 0. (multi-bit values are not supported in this
            mode.)


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -strinit <string for high> <string for low>

    ::

            use string values in the command line to represent a single-bit
            initial value of 1 or 0. (multi-bit values are not supported in this
            mode.)


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -noreinit

    ::

            fail if the FF cell has already a defined initial value set in other
            passes and the initial value of the net it drives is not equal to
            the already defined initial value.
