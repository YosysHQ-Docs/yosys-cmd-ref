    .. code:: yoscrypt

        memory_map [options] [selection]

    ::

        This pass converts multiport memory cells as generated by the memory_collect
        pass to word-wide DFFs and address decoders.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -attr !<name>

    ::

            do not map memories that have attribute <name> set.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -attr <name>[=<value>]

    ::

            for memories that have attribute <name> set, only map them if its value
            is a string <value> (if specified), or an integer 1 (otherwise). if this
            option is specified multiple times, map the memory if the attribute is
            to any of the values.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -iattr

    ::

            for -attr, ignore case of <value>.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -rom-only

    ::

            only perform conversion for ROMs (memories with no write ports).


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -keepdc

    ::

            when mapping ROMs, keep x-bits shared across read ports.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -formal

    ::

            map memories for a global clock based formal verification flow.
            This implies -keepdc, uses $ff cells for ROMs and sets hdlname
            attributes. It also has limited support for async write ports
            as generated by clk2fflogic.
