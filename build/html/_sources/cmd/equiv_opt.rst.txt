        equiv_opt [options] [command]

    ::

        This command uses temporal induction to check circuit equivalence before and
        after an optimization pass.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -run <from_label>:<to_label>

    ::

            only run the commands between the labels (see below). an empty
            from label is synonymous to the start of the command list, and empty to
            label is synonymous to the end of the command list.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -map <filename>

    ::

            expand the modules in this file before proving equivalence. this is
            useful for handling architecture-specific primitives.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -blacklist <file>

    ::

            Do not match cells or signals that match the names in the file
            (passed to equiv_make).


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -assert

    ::

            produce an error if the circuits are not equivalent.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -multiclock

    ::

            run clk2fflogic before equivalence checking.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -async2sync

    ::

            run async2sync before equivalence checking.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -undef

    ::

            enable modelling of undef states during equiv_induct.


    .. code:: yoscrypt

        -nocheck

    ::

            disable running check before and after the command under test.


    ::

        The following commands are executed by this verification command:

            run_pass:
                hierarchy -auto-top
                design -save preopt
                check -assert    (unless -nocheck)
                [command]
                check -assert    (unless -nocheck)
                design -stash postopt

            prepare:
                design -copy-from preopt  -as gold A:top
                design -copy-from postopt -as gate A:top

            techmap:    (only with -map)
                techmap -wb -D EQUIV -autoproc -map <filename> ...

            prove:
                clk2fflogic    (only with -multiclock)
                async2sync     (only with -async2sync)
                equiv_make -blacklist <filename> ... gold gate equiv
                equiv_induct [-undef] equiv
                equiv_status [-assert] equiv

            restore:
